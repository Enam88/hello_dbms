Welcome to the CarbonFootprint Calculator project! This project aims to help individuals understand and reduce their carbon footprint, specifically in the context of electricity production. By analyzing and visualizing data related to carbon emissions from different sources of electricity generation, we provide valuable insights and a user-friendly interface to empower individuals to make informed decisions.

## Project Introduction

As environmentally conscious developers, we recognized the importance of understanding and minimizing our carbon footprint. Our CarbonFootprint Calculator project focuses on electricity production and its impact on carbon emissions. Here's an overview of the project's main components:

- **Database Setup:** We set up a database to store electricity generation data by country and region.

- **SQL Queries and Data Analysis:** We use SQL queries to analyze carbon emissions from different sources of electricity generation and gain insights into energy usage patterns.

- **Flask Application:** We built a user-friendly Flask web application that allows users to explore carbon emissions data, select specific countries or regions, and view insights on energy sources and emissions.

- **Calculating Trees Required:** Our project calculates the number of trees needed to offset the carbon emissions generated by electricity production for a selected country or region.

## Database Setup

To store and manage electricity generation data, we established a database named 'CarbonFootprint.' Within this database, two tables, 'Country' and 'World,' were created to store detailed information on electricity generation and regional data.

## SQL Queries and Data Analysis

We employ SQL queries to perform in-depth data analysis and provide valuable insights into carbon emissions from electricity generation. Our queries cover a wide range of aspects, including population, energy sources, emissions per unit of electricity, and total emissions by country and region.

## Flask Application

Our user-friendly Flask web application is designed to make exploring carbon emissions data a breeze. Users can:

- Select a specific country or region.
- View insights on energy sources and emissions.
- Calculate the number of trees required to offset carbon emissions.
- Make informed decisions to reduce their environmental impact.
